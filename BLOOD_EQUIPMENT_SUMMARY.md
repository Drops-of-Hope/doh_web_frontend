  id: string;
  type: string;                    // Equipment type
  serialNumber: string;            // Unique serial
  manufacturer: string;            // Manufacturer name
  model: string;                   // Model number
  purchaseDate: string;            // ISO date
  warrantyExpiry: string;          // ISO date
  locatedMedEstId: string;         // FK to medical establishment
  status: string;                  // OPERATIONAL | MAINTENANCE | DECOMMISSIONED
  medicalEstablishment?: {         // Nested relation
    id: string;

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Recommendations:
1. Add authentication middleware to all routes
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Validate user permissions before deletions
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Sanitize all user inputs
6. Log all equipment modifications

Example:
```typescript
import { authMiddleware, roleCheck } from '../middleware';

router.delete(
  '/:id',
  authMiddleware,
  roleCheck(['admin', 'blood_bank_manager']),
  (req, res) => bloodEquipmentController.deleteEquipment(req, res)
);
```

## 🎓 Architecture Overview

This implementation follows **clean architecture** principles:

```
Frontend (React/Next.js)
    ↓
API Layer (RTK Query)
    ↓
HTTP Requests
    ↓
Backend Routes
    ↓
Controllers (Request handling)
    ↓
Services (Business logic)
    ↓
Prisma ORM
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

### Separation of Concerns:
- **Frontend**: UI components and user interactions
- **API Layer**: Data fetching and caching
- **Routes**: HTTP endpoint definitions
- **Controllers**: Request validation and response formatting
- **Services**: Database operations and business logic

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **TypeScript Safety**: All types are properly defined and enforced
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend
4. **Performance**: RTK Query provides automatic caching and optimization
5. **Scalability**: Easy to extend with additional features
